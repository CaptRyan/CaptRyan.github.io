## About Me
I am an undergraduate student at the University of Cambridge, interested in the field of <strong>robotics engineering</strong>, with expertise in mechanical design, software implementation, and a deep understanding of machine learning. I served as the Chief Mechanical Designer for my high school's FIRST Robotics Team, where I led diverse mechanical design projects and oversaw the development, testing, and validation of control algorithms. Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the University of Cambridge's <strong>Bio-Inspired Robotics Lab</strong>.

Beyond my formal experiences, I am passionate about applying machine learning to enhance intelligent robotics systems, particularly by optimizing sensor feedback readings and bridging the gap between mechanics and electrical systems.

## Research Interests

- **Robotics Design:** Robotics Cooking, Object Manipulation, End Effector Design
- **Machine Learning:** Tool Pose Estimation, Trajectory Optimisation
- **Automation:** Autonomous Robotic Systems, Path Planning with Multi-Sensor Input
